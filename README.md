Designed by Elena Cai

## Introduction
This website is deigned to help me (and you) with time management. The program is able to store tasks, assist decision making, and reduce distraction. It can be used on any desktop devices. The program is in the theme of **fun, clean, and calm**. Give it a try! 😄

## Main Function
The main function of the website including adding tasks, moving tasks to different categories, and deleting tasks. The three main categories are "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done". For each task, one can click 👉🏼 to move it to the next stage, 👈🏼 to move it to the previous stage, and 👋🏼 to delete it.

## Magic Dice & Background music
Do you always have so many things to do but procrastinate anyways because you don't know where to start from? In addition to the main function, the program also provides the **magic dice** feature to help users choose a random task to start from. The task is always chosen from the "To Do" or "In Progress" categories and will be displayed on the top of the webpage in bolded "GO DO: xxx" format. 🎲

In addition to the magic dice, the program also provides a Youtube **live music** for concentration. Now you don't have to go to Youtube to search for background music and get distracted due recommended contents! 🎵
